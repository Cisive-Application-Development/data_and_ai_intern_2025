BORN FROM DIRT

Before there was Fox Racing, there was a vision. Geoff Fox believed his high-performance suspension and engine components could give riders an on-track advantage. Driven to prove this on his terms, he founded team Moto-X Fox to compete against the might of the Japanese factory teams. The team quickly became the top non-factory riders in the competitive AMA 125 National Championship series, proving that the products he and his team designed and built were the best money could buy.

FUELED BY PASSION

Although we have expanded our activities and products into Mountain Bike, BMX, Surf and Wakeboard, the idea of elevating athletic performance through progressive innovation is still what drives us. From moto gear to apparel to outerwear, everything we make is developed with the rider in mind. No matter the terrain, the condition or the environment, Fox designs and engineers gear and apparel with the goal of making every ride a great one.

THE ONLY CONSTANT IS CHANGE

Inspired by our heritage, we continue to push limits, defy boundaries and pursue continuous innovation. With each success, we set a larger, more ambitious goal.

3425,41004,Lowes Foods,"Lowes Foods began in 1954 as a single store in North Wilkesboro, NC, and has grown to become a major supermarket chain operating in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. 

The company grew rapidly during the 1960s, '70s and early '80s. Lowes Foods was acquired by Merchants Distributors, Inc. (MDI) in 1984 and began an aggressive expansion program in 1986, opening 19 stores over the next four years. In 1997, Lowes Foods acquired Byrds Food Stores, located in eastern North Carolina. It continued its growth in 2000 with the purchase of 13 Hannaford stores. Today Lowes Foods operates close to 100 stores and continues to open new stores throughout North and South Carolina. Lowes Foods continued to expand by opening its first Lowes Foods Fuel station in 2007. In 2010, a new Lowes Foods concept store was opened in Hickory, NC and in 2011, we introduced a new value format called Just$ave.
 
In 2013, Lowes Foods set out to break the mold of the standard supermarket and create a distinctive grocery shopping experience worthy of our Carolina roots. The development began with in depth consumer research and a series of overnight workshops designed to get the very best ideas from managers across all facets of the business including all store managers and many from MDI. During these workshops, our new vision for Lowes Foods was born: “We bring community back to the table.” And, a number of new concepts were created including Chicken Kitchen, SausageWorks, Pick & Prep, and the Community Table. In January, 2013, Lowes Foods re-opened the first store to offer all of the newly developed concepts in Clemmons, NC. This spirit of transformation is being carried through all of the Lowes Foods and Just$ave stores. And, the spark of innovation has led to continued development of new concepts to further differentiate our stores.

3469,41854,Bolthouse Farms,"Our story begins in 1915 in Grant, Michigan where the Bolthouse family started farming vegetables. When William Herman Bolthouse took over the farm from his parents in 1938, he expanded and focused on the production and distribution of carrots. By 1950, Bolthouse Farms was a leading carrot supplier in the Midwest known for flavor and quality. In 1973, a second facility in Bakersfield, California was opened where year-round production was possible allowing broader distribution. 

In the 1990s, Bolthouse Farms brought a breakthrough product to the marketplace. Frustrated with the waste in the carrot business, a local Bolthouse Farms grower peeled and cut “ugly” carrots into pieces and sold them in bags. With that simple act, baby carrots were born, transforming the entire industry. Baby carrots seemed to make Americans eat more carrots, helping to double carrot consumption in the U.S. in the decade after they were introduced. 

For more than a century, Bolthouse Farms has been known as the innovation leader in growing and distributing carrots and high-quality, innovative branded products. Employing more than 2,200 people and still headquartered in Bakersfield in California’s fertile San Joaquin Valley, Bolthouse Farms is one of the largest carrot growers and distributors in the U.S. Guided by our vision – Plants Powering People – we produce and sell super-premium juices, smoothies, café beverages, protein shakes, functional beverages and premium refrigerated dressings all under the Bolthouse Farms® brand name.",5.0,CA,US,Bakersfield,93307,7200 East Brundage Lane,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bolthouse-farms

They contemplate spiritual and religious dimensions of life. 

Whatever their individual backgrounds, something deep inside moved and inspired them all to create brighter futures for themselves.

7510,424932,Orlebar Brown,"The idea for Orlebar Brown came on holiday. Adam Brown was at a friend’s birthday party in Rajasthan in 2005. When it was time for lunch, he arrived at the restaurant wearing wet swimming trunks. Not looking smart enough, he was turned away. And in that moment the idea for O.B was born – what he needed was not a better swim short - but a short that you can swim in.  

OB launched in 2007 with one style in 4 lengths and 5 colours. 
OB Classic swim shorts are still our best-selling product – a swim short based on the pattern of a traditional man’s suit trouser. They have a perfect fit and are instantly recognisable thanks to their signature side-fasteners. With over sixty elements in each pair, OB Classic swim shorts are made from 100% recycled plastic and we are so confident in their quality that they are guaranteed for 5 years. 

In 2007 Orlebar Brown only made swim shorts. 
In 2010 we moved out of the pool, off the beach and into the resort in with our first polos and t-shirts. 
We have since expanded into shirts, trousers, jackets, shorts, knitwear, footwear and outerwear – everything you could possibly need to Holiday Better. 

96% our products are made in Europe and they feature premium fabrics including cashmere, merino, cotton silk, linen and silk. They featured thoughtful tailored touches, classic colours and rich prints. And all of them are vibrant, tailored and brave. 

Since 2018 Orlebar Brown has been part of Chanel. We are a global brand with more than 40 direct stores, and over 250 additional locations in great cities and gorgeous resorts around the world including London, Paris, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Sydney, Dubai, St. Tropez, Marbella, Ibiza, Mykonos, St. Barths and East Hampton.",3.0,London,GB,London,W1T 3EY,"87-91 Newman Street, ",https://www.linkedin.com/company/orlebar-brown

8217,612493,Public Utility Commission of Texas,"The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) regulates the state's electric, telecommunication, and water and sewer utilities, implements respective legislation, and offers customer assistance in resolving consumer complaints. It does so while working to protect consumers, foster competition, and promote high quality infrastructure.
 
The PUC was born in 1975 when the Texas Legislature enacted the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA) and charged the agency with providing statewide regulation of the rates and services of electric and telecommunications utilities. 

As a result of deregulation and the institution of a competitive energy market, the PUC's mission and focus shifted from regulation of rates and services to oversight of competitive markets and compliance enforcement of statutes and rules for the electric and telecommunication industries, focused on ensuring customers receive the benefits of competition. For water and sewer utility service, however, the focus remains on the regulation of rates and services.

The PUC continues to perform its traditional regulatory function for electric transmission and distribution utilities across the state. Additionally, while integrated electric utilities outside of the ERCOT power grid remain fully regulated by the PUC, the PUC is increasingly involved in multi-state efforts to implement wholesale electric competitive market structures and transmission planning in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) areas.

In 2013, the Texas Legislature transferred the economic regulation of water and sewer utilities to the PUC. This transfer involved the functions with respect to the regulation of water and sewer rates and services, Certificates of Convenience and Necessity (CCNs) and Sale/Transfer/Mergers from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to the PUC.

We saw a disconnect in the bigger healthcare staffing agencies, and took that as an opportunity to fill that void.

Very true that the industry (and healthcare in general) is constantly changing, but we don’t believe that how we partner with our healthcare professionals, or interact with our internal staff, should. Regardless of how big we may get, our main focus is to remember who makes this all work. That’s our employees, whether nurses or internal.

The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is a regional provider of water, wastewater and solid waste disposal services. The NTMWD serves a population of 2 million residents in 80 communities across the north Texas counties of Collin, Dallas, Denton, Fannin, Grayson, Hopkins, Hunt, Kaufman, Rains, and Rockwall – a service territory covering 2,200 square miles. 

History:
In 1946, local leaders from ten cities formed the Tri-County Reservoir Association (TCRA) to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build Lavon Lake for flood control and water storage. By request of the TCRA, the Texas Legislature authorized the formation of the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) in 1951 to develop, finance, construct, and operate facilities to meet future water needs for the region. 

The 10 original cities - Farmersville, Forney, Garland, McKinney, Mesquite, Plano, Princeton, Rockwall, Royse City, and Wylie - became the original Member Cities, each with representation on our Board of Directors. Three additional cities were added including Richardson (1973), Allen (1998), and Frisco (2001). We also provide treated water service to 33 Customers (cities and other special/municipal utility districts) and indirectly serve 46 other communities who purchase water from our Member Cities and Customers. 

We began offering wastewater treatment services in the 1970s and solid waste disposal services in the 1980s. We also operate the largest man-made wetlands in the country - a vital water reuse project that helps to naturally polish treated wastewater, supplement our water supplies, and supports a valuable ecosystem to the region.

Under the leadership of CEO, Mark Cafua, CMC prides itself on being a family company, with a People First culture, dedicated to providing the best in quality and service to our guests.

Cafua Management Company started out in 1980, when Fernando and Gilda Cafua, were presented with an opportunity that changed the course of their lives, and that of their three boys, Mark, David and Gregory. Hard working immigrants from the island of Sao Miguel, Portugal, Gilda worked as a seamstress, and Fernando juggled three jobs to make ends meet, including one as a baker for Dunkin’ Donuts. The Dunkin’ Donuts job turned into an opportunity to invest in their first store, located in Derry, NH.

Determined to make it successful, the family, including the three boys, worked tirelessly in the store, sometimes sleeping out back on a mattress hidden under a desk in the office, or napping on bags of flour and sugar.  Their hard work paid off, allowing the Cafuas to invest in more stores, and to provide more opportunity for hard working strivers like themselves.  Mark, David and Gregory remember growing up in the business fondly, and are proud to have worked in every position possible over the years, even standing on milk crates at a young age so they could take orders from behind the counter. 
 
Fernando and Gilda moved to Florida in 2007, leaving CMC in the capable hands of their sons. Mark serves as CEO, David as Chief Property Officer and Gregory as Chief Business Officer, each taking on roles that suit their strengths, and working hard to build upon their parents’ legacy.

I will win because the vast majority of South Dakotans agree that we need someone in Congress who will fight for the FREEDOM to make personal decisions without government interference. 
•	I will fight to keep the government out of women’s health care and reproductive decisions. 
•	I will fight to protect IVF treatments
•	I will fight for the rights of our LBGTQ and minority communities to live in peace and safety.
•	I will fight to prevent private corporations from taking farmer’s land through eminent domain
•	I will fight to keep healthcare prices down
•	I will fight to invest in rural infrastructure
•	I will fight for our right to vote without having to hurdle obstacles
